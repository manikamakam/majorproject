Design and Simulation of a Fully Functional Self Driving Car using Applied Deep Learning

• Designed a car which is capable of self-driving on a track and identifies 43 different road symbols.
• Used Image processing and Machine Learning concepts to achieve this project.
• Implemented LeNet model of Convolutional Neural Network for self-driving and Nvidia Deep Learning framework to classify road symbols.
